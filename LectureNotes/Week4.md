# 6.036 Week4

这一节主要讲的是用优化手段来进行机器学习:

1. 优化的对象，也就是 object function。这节课举 LLC 的 NLL 为例子
2. 优化的方法。这节课举 gradient decent 为例子

// TODO: 之后再说，有点无聊不想写

## Logistic regression

And so, fundamentally, the idea here
is that instead of trying to intuit cool learning
algorithms, like perceptron, we're
going to come up with a machinery that
will let us drive machine learning
algorithms for arbitrarily complicated problems.

So optimization is an important field in applied math,
and numerical methods, and computer science.
It's a way of taking some function
and trying to use computational methods to find
a minimum or a maximum of that function.
So we're going to see if we can turn machine learning
problems into optimization problems,

"ML as optimization"

## Gradient Descent
